# Diabetic-retinopathy-detection-system
Python Keras VGG-16
The purpose of this project is to determine whether the patient has diabetic retinopathy by using the convolutional neural network to extract features and using Softmax to classify the fundus images.
The public data set you can download on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data)
The interface is written using wxpython.
